# AST Functions

This is a simple collection of utilities intended to read in the properties found in an AST as generated by a Solidity compiler.

There are times when the definitions provided by the ABI are too limited, specifically that it doesn't contain the struct or enum definitions because they're not considered part of the interface.

-----

## Usage

Usage will typically be to import either `loadAll` or specific functions.

```
const { loadAll } = require('ast-functions');

const astObject = loadAll(astFromWherever);
```
## Output

This will create an object that contains an array of the input parameters (name and type), output parameters (name and type) and the `stateMutability`. The latter includes whether it's public, payable, etc.
